A website that will be created for better mental health

The website is called Mindful Buddy.

This website's purpose was to provide people with a fun way to do their daily tasks! 
Sometimes people who are struggling mentally may have a hard time drinking enough water or eating enough food.
This app is directed towards those who may struggle mentally, but anyone can use the website.  
Mindful Buddy is a way to provide users motivation towards doing those tasks, hoping 
that eventually, the to-do lists that they do will become a habit they develop.
All the while providing people with information about their condition if necessary. 
The user has a to-do list to complete their tasks, and whenever a task is completed, 
the user will get a coin. With the coin that the user gets, a shop will be available 
with tons of cute animals and the user can use their coins to adopt the animals as their pets.

Mindful Buddy wants to address mental health problems that are problematic in one's day-to-day
lives. By making self-care tasks a fun game, it encourages the user to perform more personal
wants and productive actions which encourages a healthier lifestyle. This in turn improves 
one's mood, energy, and self-image as they are improving themselves, and spending the time to
become more productive. Mindful Buddy has the intention of wanting the user to better their mental
health through living a healthier lifestyle.

With a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Mindful Buddy provides an excellent way for users 
to get motivation towards completing their daily tasks. 

To install and run the project. Download the ZIP main file and unzip that file in a location that will be remembered.
When using VSCode, go to file -> open folder -> select the folder in the location that you remembered it in.

You will be introduced with a welcome message and a random motivational quote to help inspire you!
The rest of the website is simple! There are three links up on top that direct you to different 
screens. The main screen is where you get to see how many coins you have, and will have all the 
navigation parts of the website. The To-Do List screen will provide you with the to-do list for 
today where you input what you want to do for that day. Each time a task is completed that will
count for a coin. The resources page is where the user can find any information/websites that 
they will need for any type of aid for mental illness or stress. Finally, the a shop where there 
will be multiple animals where the user can adopt their pets using the coins they gained through
completing their tasks.

Mindful Buddy is worked on by Albert Huynh, Dana Fakhreddine, Viviana Lopez, and Aleena Mehmood for SparkHacks 2024
